# SPICE-Simulation-of-Low-Pass-and-High-Pass-Filters üñ•Ô∏è

‚Ä¢ Designed and simulated RC low-pass and high-pass filters using SPICE, achieving desired cutoff frequencies and
analyzing their frequency responses.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Compared simulation results with theoretical predictions, verifying the filters‚Äô performance and accuracy through
frequency response curves.<br/>
