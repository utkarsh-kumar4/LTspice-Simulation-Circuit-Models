# SPICE-Simulation-of-Low-Pass-and-High-Pass-Filters

• Designed and simulated RC low-pass and high-pass filters using SPICE, achieving desired cutoff frequencies and
analyzing their frequency responses.<br/>
• Compared simulation results with theoretical predictions, verifying the filters’ performance and accuracy through
frequency response curves.<br/>
